RobotHaikubot is a twitter bot built by Ben Perisot, Marty Martinez, Chris Lu, Cheri Portman, and Emily Baier. This project was built for our mid-term project at Alchemy Code Lab.

RobotHaikubot, upon being tweeted at, sends out a random haiku composed of lines stored in a database.

The lines have been added by our team, as well as sourced from twitter users and fellow students.

Please add to our project! Here is a list of things we envision RobotHaikubot will be able to do in the near future - perhaps youâ€™d like to contribute?
